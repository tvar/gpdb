title: Deploying a Connector
---

The Greenplum Database administrator deploys a connector to a Greenplum Database cluster by first registering the connector and its dependencies, and then copying relevant JAR and configuration files across the Greenplum Database cluster. After deploying the connector, the administrator must restart the PXF agent.


## <a id="runtime_depends"></a> Identifying Connector Run-Time Dependencies

You must identify your connector's run-time dependencies on other JAR files.

You must also identify any dependencies that your connector has on third-party commands or other components on the system. These commands and components must be installed on all Greenplum Database segment hosts. Any programs on which your connector depends must be executable by the `gpadmin` operating system user.

## <a id="deploy_depends"></a>Registering Connector Run-Time Dependencies

The PXF agent determines certain runtime dependencies from configuration files found in the `$GPHOME/pxf/conf` directory. Only the Greenplum Database administrative user can register PXF dependencies.

The `pxf-private.classpath` configuration file identifies the runtime dependencies for the PXF agent itself. This file also identifies the runtime dependencies for the PXF built-in HDFS, Hive, and HBase connectors.

The Greenplum Database administrator registers a third-party connector and its runtime dependencies in the `pxf-public.classpath` configuration file. Entries in the `pxf-public.classpath` file identify the absolute path of a JAR file or a configuration directory, and are listed one per line.

**Note**: The `pxf-public.classpath` file on a Greenplum Database segment host is shared by all third-party connectors running in the cluster.


## <a id="deploy_to_cluster"></a>Deploying to the Greenplum Database Cluster

When the Greenplum Database administrator deploys a new connector, they copy the connector JAR file and the (JAR) files of any dependencies to each Greenplum Database segment host. The administrator must also propagate any updates to the `pxf-public.classpath` configuration file to each segment host, and then must restart the PXF agent on each host. Only the Greenplum Database administrative user can restart the PXF agent. 

For example, if `seghostfile` contains a list, one-host-per-line, of the segment hosts in your Greenplum Database cluster, these commands deploy the connector across the cluster:

``` shell
gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpscp my-connector.jar -v -f seghostfile =:/my/jar/install/dir
gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpscp connector-dependency.jar -v -seghostfile /dependency/install/dir
gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpscp -v -f seghostfile $GPHOME/pxf/conf/pxf-public.classpath =:/usr/local/greenplum-db/pxf/conf/pxf-public.classpath
gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpssh -e -v -f seghostfile "/usr/local/greenplum-db/pxf/bin/pxf restart"
```

The administrator must also install any third-party commands or other components used by the connector on all Greenplum Database segment hosts and ensure that these programs are executable by the `gpadmin` operating system user.


## <a id="verify_deploy"></a>Verifying Connector Deployment

To verify that you deployed a connector successfully, you create a Greenplum Database external table and invoke `SELECT` and/or `INSERT` commands on the table to test read and write operations on the external data source.

The Greenplum Database end user accesses an external data source by invoking a `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` command specifying the `pxf` protocol. (Refer to the [CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE](../../ref_guide/sql_commands/CREATE_EXTERNAL_TABLE.html) reference page for more about this Greenplum Database command.)

The `LOCATION` clause of a `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` command specifying the `pxf` protocol is a URI that specifies the external data source and the location, path to, or name of the data. The query portion of the `pxf` protocol URI, introduced by a question mark (?), must include a profile name or the fully-qualified plug-in class names of the connector. 

[Creating an External Table using PXF](../using_pxf.html#creatinganexternaltable) in the PXF end user documentation details how to create an external table when specifying a profile name. The syntax for a `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` command that specifies the Java plug-in class names in the `LOCATION` clause follows:

``` sql
CREATE [WRITABLE] EXTERNAL TABLE <table_name>
        ( <column_name> <data_type> [, ...] | LIKE <other_table> )
LOCATION('pxf://<path-to-data>?[FRAGMENTER=<fragmenter_class>
        &]ACCESSOR=<accessor_class>
        &RESOLVER=<resolver_class>
        [&<custom-option>=<value>[...]]')
FORMAT '[TEXT|CSV|CUSTOM]' (<formatting-properties>);
```

The `LOCATION` clause identifies the Java plug-in classes that PXF will use to split (`FRAGMENTER`), read and/or write (`ACCESSOR`), and deserialize/serialize (`RESOLVER`) the external data.


## <a id="example"></a>Example: Deploying the Demo Connector 

In this exercise you deploy the *Demo* connector, its dependencies, and configuration files and verify the deploy operation.

### <a id="about_connector"></a>About the Demo Connector

Recall that your copy of the *Demo* connector resides in the `org.greenplum.pxf.example.demo` package.

#### <a id="demo_classes"></a>Plug-in Classes

The *Demo* connector read operation uses the following plug-in classes:

- Fragmenter - `org.greenplum.pxf.example.demo.DemoFragmenter`
- Read Accessor - `org.greenplum.pxf.example.demo.DemoAccessor`
- Read Resolver - `org.greenplum.pxf.example.demo.DemoTextResolver`

The *Demo* connector write operation uses the following plug-in classes:

- Write Accessor - `org.greenplum.pxf.example.demo.DemoFileWritableAccessor`
- Write Resolver - `org.greenplum.pxf.example.demo.DemoTextResolver`

Notice that the *Demo* connector read and write operations share the same *Resolver* class but use different *Accessor* classes.

#### <a id="demo_depends"></a>Run-Time Dependencies

The *Demo* connector has a run-time dependency on the Apache Commons Logging JAR, `commons-logging.jar`. This JAR file is installed with a Hadoop distribution and should already be specified in the `pxf-private.classpath` file.

### <a id="deploy_prereqs"></a>Prerequisites

Before attempting this exercise, ensure that you have:

- Built the *Demo* connector as described in [Example: Building the Demo Connector JAR File](build_conn.html#demo_buildjar).
- Administrative access to a running Greenplum Database cluster.
- Initialized, configured, and started the PXF agent on each Greenplum Database segment host as described in [Configuring PXF](https://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io/latest/pxf/instcfg_pxf.html).
- Enabled the PXF extension in the database, and optionally granted specific Greenplum Database roles access to the `pxf` protocol; [Enabling/Disabling PXF](https://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io/latest/pxf/using_pxf.html#enable-pxf-ext) and [Granting Access to PXF](https://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io/latest/pxf/using_pxf.html#access_pxf) describe these procedures.

### <a id="procedure"></a>Procedure

Perform the following procedure to deploy the *Demo* connector and to verify that you deployed the connector successfully:

1. Log in to the Greenplum Database master node as an administrative user and set up your environment:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh gpadmin@<gpmaster>
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ . /usr/local/greenplum-db/greenplum_path.sh
    ```

2. Copy the *Demo* connector JAR file that you previously built to the Greenplum Database master host. For example, to copy the JAR file to the `/tmp` directory, replace `PXFDEV_BASE` with the absolute path to your PXF development work area:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ scp user@devsystem:/PXFDEV_BASE/demo_example/build/libs/my-demo-connector.jar /tmp/
    ```

3. Open the `pxf-public.classpath` file in the editor of your choosing. For example:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ vi $GPHOME/pxf/conf/pxf-public.classpath
    ```

4. Add an entry for the *Demo* connector JAR file to the `pxf-public.classpath` file. This entry should specify the absolute path of the *Demo* connector JAR file on the system. For example, if `my-demo-connector.jar` resides in the `/tmp` directory, add the following:

    ``` pre
    /tmp/my-demo-connector.jar
    ```

5. Save the file and exit the editor.

7. Copy the `pxf-public.classpath` file to all segment hosts in your Greenplum Database cluster. For example, if `seghostfile` contains a list, one-host-per-line, of the segment hosts in your Greenplum Database cluster:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpscp -v -f seghostfile $GPHOME/pxf/conf/pxf-public.classpath =:/usr/local/greenplum-db/pxf/conf/pxf-public.classpath
    ```
8. Copy the *Demo* connector JAR file to all Greenplum Database segment hosts. Copy the JAR file to the location you specified in the `pxf-public.classpath` file. For example:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpscp -v -f seghostfile /tmp/my-demo-connector.jar =:/tmp/my-demo-connector.jar
    ```

9. Restart PXF on each segment host. For example:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpssh -e -v -f seghostfile "/usr/local/greenplum-db/pxf/bin/pxf restart"
    ```
    
11. Verify that you correctly deployed the *Demo* connector by creating and accessing Greenplum Database readable and writable external tables that specify the *Demo* connector plug-ins:

    1. Connect to a database in which you created the PXF extension as the `gpadmin` user. For example, to connect to a database named `pxf_exampledb`:

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ psql -d pxf_exampledb -U gpadmin
        ```
        
    2. Create a readable Greenplum external table to exercise the *Demo* connector read operation. For example:

        ``` sql
        pxf_exampledb=# CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE demo_tbl_read (a TEXT, b TEXT, c TEXT)
            LOCATION ('pxf://default/tmp/dummy1?FRAGMENTER=org.greenplum.pxf.example.demo.DemoFragmenter&ACCESSOR=org.greenplum.pxf.example.demo.DemoAccessor&RESOLVER=org.greenplum.pxf.example.demo.DemoTextResolver')
            FORMAT 'TEXT' (DELIMITER ',');
        CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE
        ```
        
        (The Demo connector read operation returns static data. You could have specified any file path in the `LOCATION` clause; it will be ignored by the *Demo* connector.)
        
    3. Query the `demo_tbl_read` table:

        ``` sql
        pxf_exampledb=# SELECT * from demo_tbl_read;
               a        |   b    |   c    
        ----------------+--------+--------
         fragment2 row1 | value1 | value2
         fragment2 row2 | value1 | value2
         fragment1 row1 | value1 | value2
         fragment1 row2 | value1 | value2
         fragment3 row1 | value1 | value2
         fragment3 row2 | value1 | value2
        (6 rows)
        ```

    4. Create a writable Greenplum external table to exercise the *Demo* connector write operation. For example:

        ``` sql
        pxf_exampledb=# CREATE WRITABLE EXTERNAL TABLE demo_tbl_write (a TEXT, b TEXT, c TEXT)
            LOCATION ('pxf://tmp/demo_write_1?ACCESSOR=org.greenplum.pxf.example.demo.DemoFileWritableAccessor&RESOLVER=org.greenplum.pxf.example.demo.DemoTextResolver')
            FORMAT 'TEXT' (DELIMITER ',');
        CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE
        ```
        
    5. Write some text data into the `demo_tbl_write` table. For example:

        ``` sql
        pxf_exampledb=# INSERT INTO demo_tbl_write VALUES ('x', 'y', 'z');
        INSERT 0 1
        pxf_exampledb=# INSERT INTO demo_tbl_write VALUES ('u', 'v', 'w');
        INSERT 0 1
        pxf_exampledb=# INSERT INTO demo_tbl_write VALUES ('r', 's', 't');
        INSERT 0 1
        ```

        Each `INSERT` command writes a file to the directory named  `/tmp/demo_write_1` on the local file system.  

    6. View the contents of the `/tmp/demo_write_1` directory on the local file system. For example:

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ cat /tmp/demo_write_1/*
        x,y,z
        u,v,w
        r,s,t
        ```

You successfully deployed the *Demo* connector. If you choose, you may deploy read and write profiles for the *Demo* connector as a convenience to the end user. See [Deploying a Profile](deploy_profile.html) for profile definition and deployment instructions.
