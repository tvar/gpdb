title: Upgrading PXF
---

If you are using PXF in your current Greenplum Database installation, you must upgrade the PXF service when you upgrade to a new version of Greenplum Database.

The PXF upgrade procedure describes how to upgrade PXF in your Greenplum Database installation. This procedure uses *PXF.from* to refer to your currently-installed PXF version and *PXF.to* to refer to the PXF version installed when you upgrade to the new version of Greenplum Database.

Most PXF installations do not require modifications to PXF configuration files and should experience a seamless upgrade.

**Note**: Starting in Greenplum Database version 5.12.0, PXF no longer requires a Hadoop client installation. PXF now bundles all of the JAR files on which it depends, and loads these JARs at runtime. PXF still requires that the Hadoop configuration files reside in `/etc/<hadoop-service>/conf`.

The PXF upgrade procedure has two parts. You perform one procedure before, and one procedure after, you upgrade to a new version of Greenplum Database:

-   [Step 1: PXF Pre-Upgrade Actions](#pxfpre)
-   Upgrade to a new Greenplum Database version
-   [Step 2: Upgrading PXF](#pxfup)


## <a id="pxfpre"></a>Step 1: PXF Pre-Upgrade Actions

Perform this procedure before you upgrade to a new version of Greenplum Database:

1. Log in to the Greenplum Database master node and set up the environment. For example:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh gpadmin@<gpmaster>
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ . /usr/local/greenplum-db/greenplum_path.sh
    ```

2. Create a text file that lists your Greenplum Database segment hosts, one host name per line. For example, a file named `seghostfile` may include:

    ``` pre
    seghost1
    seghost2
    seghost3
    ```

3. Run the `pxf stop` command to stop PXF on each segment host. For example:

    ``` shell
    $ gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpssh -e -v -f seghostfile "/usr/local/greenplum-db/pxf/bin/pxf stop"
    ```

4. Back up the *PXF.from* configuration files found in the `$GPHOME/pxf/conf/` directory. These files should be the same on all segment hosts, so you need only copy from one of the hosts. For example:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ mkdir -p /save/pxf-from-conf
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ scp gpadmin@seghost1:/usr/local/greenplum-db/pxf/conf/* /save/pxf-from-conf/
    ```

5. Note the locations of any custom JAR files that you may have added to your *PXF.from* installation. Save a copy of these JAR files in case they are removed or altered when you upgrade to the new version of Greenplum Database.

6. Upgrade to the new version of Greenplum Database and then continue your PXF upgrade with [Step 2: Upgrading PXF](#pxfup).


## <a id="pxfup"></a>Step 2: Upgrading PXF

After you upgrade to the new version of Greenplum Database, perform the following procedure to upgrade and configure the *PXF.to* software:

1. Log in to the Greenplum Database master node and set up the environment. For example:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh gpadmin@<gpmaster>
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ . /usr/local/greenplum-db/greenplum_path.sh
    ```

2. PXF user impersonation is on by default in Greenplum Database version 5.5.0 and later. If you are upgrading from an older *PXF.from* version, you must configure user impersonation for the underlying Hadoop services. Refer to [Configuring User Impersonation and Proxying](pxfuserimpers.html) for instructions, including the configuration procedure to turn off PXF user impersonation.

2. If you updated the `pxf-env.sh` configuration file in your *PXF.from* installation, re-apply those changes to the file, and copy the updated `pxf-env.sh` to all segment hosts. For example, if `seghostfile` contains a list, one-host-per-line, of the segment hosts in your Greenplum Database cluster:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ vi /usr/local/greenplum-db/pxf/conf/pxf-env.sh
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpscp -v -f seghostfile /usr/local/greenplum-db/pxf/conf/pxf-env.sh =:/usr/local/greenplum-db/pxf/conf/pxf-env.sh
    ```
    
3. Initialize PXF on each segment host as described in [Initializing PXF](cfginitstart_pxf.html#init_pxf).

4. If you updated any of the `pxf-profiles.xml`, `pxf-log4j.properties`, or `pxf-public.classpath` configuration files in your *PXF.from* installation, re-apply those changes and copy the updated file(s) to all segment hosts. Refer to Step 3 above for a similar `gpscp` command.

    **Note:** Starting in Greenplum Database version 5.12.0, the package name for PXF classes was changed to use the prefix `org.greenplum.*`. If you are upgrading from an older *PXF.from* version and you customized the `pxf-profiles.xml` file, you must change any `org.apache.hawq.pxf.*` references to `org.greenplum.pxf.*` when you re-apply your changes.

5. If you added additional JAR files to your *PXF.from* installation, copy them to the corresponding directory in your *PXF.to* installation **on each segment host**.
 
6. Start PXF on each segment host as described in [Starting PXF](cfginitstart_pxf.html#start_pxf).
