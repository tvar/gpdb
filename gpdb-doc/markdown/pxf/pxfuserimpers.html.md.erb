title: Configuring User Impersonation and Proxying
---

PXF accesses Hadoop services on behalf of Greenplum Database end users. By default, PXF tries to access data source services (HDFS, Hive, HBase) using the identity of the Greenplum Database user account that logs into Greenplum Database and performs an operation using a PXF connector profile. Keep in mind that PXF uses only the _login_ identity of the user when accessing Hadoop services. For example, if a user logs into Greenplum Database as the user `jane` and then execute `SET ROLE` or `SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION` to assume a different user identity, all PXF requests still use the identity `jane` to access Hadoop services. 

With the default PXF configuration, you must explicitly configure each Hadoop data source (HDFS, Hive, HBase) to allow the PXF process owner (usually `gpadmin`) to act as a proxy for impersonating users or groups. See [Configuring Hadoop Proxying](#hadoop), [Hive User Impersonation](#hive), and [HBase User Impersonation](#hbase).  

As an alternative, you can disable PXF user impersonation. With user impersonation disabled, PXF executes all Hadoop service requests as the PXF process owner (usually `gpadmin`). This behavior matches earlier releases of PXF, but it provides no means to control access to Hadoop services for different Greenplum Database users in Hadoop. It requires that the `gpadmin` user have access to all files and directories in HDFS, and all tables in Hive and HBase that are referenced in PXF external table definitions. See [Configuring PXF User Impersonation](#pxf_cfg_proc) for information about disabling user impersonation.

## <a id="pxf_cfg_proc"></a>Configure PXF User Impersonation

Perform the following procedure to turn PXF user impersonation on or off in your Greenplum Database cluster. User impersonation is enabled by default.

1. Log in to your Greenplum Database master node as the administrative user and set up the environment:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh gpadmin@<gpmaster>
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ . /usr/local/greenplum-db/greenplum_path.sh
    ```

2. Open the `$GPHOME/pxf/conf/pxf-env.sh` file in a text editor. For example:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ vi $GPHOME/pxf/conf/pxf-env.sh
    ```

3. Locate the `PXF_USER_IMPERSONATION` setting in the `pxf-env.sh` file. Set the value to `true` to turn PXF user impersonation on, or `false` to turn it off. For example:

    ``` shell
    PXF_USER_IMPERSONATION="true"
    ```

4. Copy the updated `pxf-env.sh` file to each Greenplum Database segment host. For example, if `seghostfile` contains a list, one-host-per-line, of the segment hosts in your Greenplum Database cluster:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpscp -v -f seghostfile $GPHOME/pxf/conf/pxf-env.sh =:/usr/local/greenplum-db/pxf/conf/pxf-env.sh
    ```

5. Restart PXF on each Greenplum Database segment host to apply the new setting. For example:

    ``` shell
    $ gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpssh -e -v -f seghostfile "/usr/local/greenplum-db/pxf/bin/pxf restart"
    ```

## <a id="hadoop"></a>Configure Hadoop Proxying

When PXF user personation is enabled (the default), you must configure the Hadoop `core-site.xml` configuration file to permit user impersonation for PXF. Follow these steps:

1. Open the `core-site.xml` configuration file using a text editor, or use Ambari to add or edit the Hadoop property values described in this procedure.

2. Set the property `hadoop.proxyuser.<name>.hosts` to specify the list of PXF host names from which proxy requests are permitted. Substitute the PXF proxy user (generally `gpadmin`) for `<name>`, and provide multiple PXF host names in a comma-separated list.  For example:

    ``` xml
    <property>
        <name>hadoop.proxyuser.gpadmin.hosts</name>
        <value>pxfhost1,pxfhost2,pxfhost3</value>
    </property>
    ```
3. Set the property `hadoop.proxyuser.<name>.groups` to specify the list of HDFS groups that PXF can impersonate. You should limit this list to only those groups that require access to HDFS data from PXF.  For example:

    ``` xml
    <property>
        <name>hadoop.proxyuser.gpadmin.groups</name>
        <value>group1,group2</value>
    </property>
    ```
4. After changing `core-site.xml`, you must restart Hadoop for your changes to take effect.

## <a id="hive"></a>Hive User Impersonation

The PXF Hive connector uses the Hive MetaStore to determine the HDFS locations of Hive tables, and then accesses the underlying HDFS files directly. No specific impersonation configuration is required for Hive, because the Hadoop proxy configuration in `core-site.xml` also applies to Hive tables accessed in this manner.


## <a id="hbase"></a>HBase User Impersonation

In order for user impersonation to work with HBase, you must enable the `AccessController` coprocessor in the HBase configuration and restart the cluster. See [61.3 Server-side Configuration for Simple User Access Operation](http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#hbase.secure.configuration) in the Apache HBase Reference Guide for the required `hbase-site.xml` configuration settings.
