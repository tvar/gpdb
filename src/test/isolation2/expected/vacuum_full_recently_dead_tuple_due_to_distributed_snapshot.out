-- OldestXmin and hence safely can be declared DEAD but based on distributed
-- snapshot HeapTupleSatisfiesVacuum() returns HEAPTUPLE_RECENTLY_DEAD. Later
-- though while moving the tuples around as part of vacuum, distributed snapshot
-- was not consulted but instead xmin was only checked against OldestXmin
-- raising the "ERROR: updated tuple is already HEAP_MOVED_OFF".
